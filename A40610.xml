            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My Lord <hi>Argile</hi> was of opinion, that without them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be done; and that if that number were raiſed in <hi>England</hi> to the ſaid Earl, he would come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland</hi> with them; and that there being ſo few Horſe and Dragoons to meet them, he judg'd he might get the Countrey without trouble, having ſuch a ſtanding Body for their Friends to Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouze to; and the ſaid Earl ſaid he could ſhow the Deponent the convenient places for Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he underſtood; and as the Deponent remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, where the Ships could attend. The Deponent remembers not the names of the places. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent ſpoke to the Lord <hi>Stairs,</hi> but cannot be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that he named the Affair to him, but found him ſhy: but the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> told him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he thought <hi>Stairs</hi> might be gain'd to them: And that the Earl of <hi>Lowdoun</hi> being a man of good Reaſon and diſoblig'd, would have great influence upon the Country, and recommended the Deponent to Major <hi>Holms,</hi> with whom the Deponent had ſome acquaintance before, and had brought over a Letter from him to the Earl of <hi>Argile;</hi> but the Deponent had not then commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate any thing to the ſaid <hi>Holms.

During the time of the Deponent his abode in <hi>Holland,</hi> tho he had ſeveral Letters from <hi>Shepard,</hi> yet there was no ſatisfactory account, till ſome time after the Deponent parted from the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and was making for a Ship at <hi>Roterdam</hi> to tranſport himſelf to <hi>England. James Stuart</hi> wrot to him that there was hopes of the Money.

Horſe and Dragoons, Sir <hi>John</hi> carried him to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> to whom the Deponent propoſed the Affair, but being
<pb facs="tcp:109889:2"/> an abſolute Stranger to the Deponent, had no return from him at that time; but afterwards having met him accidently at Mr. <hi>Shepards</hi> houſe, where he the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had come to ſpeak to <hi>Shepard</hi> about the Money above named, as Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> told the Deponent. The Deponent (when they were done ſpeaking) deſired to ſpeak to the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> did, and having reiterate the former Propoſition for the 30000. pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> and the 1000. Horſe and Dragoons, he the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> told the Deponent, they could not get ſo much raiſed at the time, but if they had 10000. pound to begin, that would draw People in, and when they were once in, they would ſoon be brought to more; but as for the 1000. Horſe and Dragoons, he could ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the preſent, for that behoved to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed upon the Borders.

The Deponent met twice or thrice with the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cochran, Jerviſwood,</hi> Commiſſar <hi>Monro,</hi> the two <hi>Ceſsnocks, Montgomery</hi> of <hi>Langſhaw,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Veatch,</hi> where they diſcourſed of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be ſent to <hi>Argyle,</hi> in order to the carrying on the Affair, and tho he cannot be poſitive the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair was named, yet it was underſtood by himſelf, and as he conceives by all preſent, to be for riſing in Arms, for rectifying the Government. Commiſſary <hi>Monro,</hi> Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> and the two <hi>Ceſsnocks</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt medling with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe they judged them men that would talk, and would not do, but were more inclined to do ſomething by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if it could be done. The Lord <hi>Melvil</hi> thought every thing hazardous, and therefore the Deponent cannot ſay he was poſitive in any thing, but was moſt inclined to have the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to head them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which no particular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was laid down. <hi>Jerriſwood,</hi> the Deponent, and Mr. <hi>Veatch</hi> were for taking the Money at one of theſe Meetings. It was reſolved, that Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> late Clerk of the Juſtice Court, ſhould be ſent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to deſire their Friends to hinder the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie from Riſing, or taking raſh Reſolutions upon the account of the Council, till they ſhould ſee how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters went in <hi>England.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Martin</hi> did go at the Charges of the Gentlemen of the Meeting, and was directed to the Laird of <hi>Polwart</hi> and <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> who ſent back word that it would not be found ſo eaſy a matter to get the Gentrie of <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur: But afterwards in a Letter to Commiſſar <hi>Monro, Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart</hi> wrot that the Countrey was readier to concur than they had imagined, or ſomething to that purpoſe. The Deponent, as above-ſaid, having brought over a Key from <hi>Holland,</hi> to ſerve himſelf and Major <hi>Holms:</hi> he remembers not that ever he had an exact Copy of it, but that ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other keeped it, and ſo it chanced to be in his cuſtody when a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> came to Major <hi>Holms,</hi> intimating, that he would join with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and follow his Meaſures, or obey his Directions: this Mr <hi>Veatch</hi> thought fit to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and for the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it was brought to the Deponent and he gave the Key to Mr. <hi>Veatch,</hi> who as the Deponent was informed, was to give it and the Letter to Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon,</hi> and he to ſhow it to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> but what was done in it the Deponent knows not. The Deponent heard the Deſign of Killing the King and Duke, from Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> who told the Deponent ſome were full upon it. The Deponent heard that <hi>Aron Smith</hi> was ſent by thoſe in <hi>England</hi> to call Sir <hi>John Cochran,</hi> on the account of <hi>Carolina,</hi> but that he does not know <hi>Aron Smith,</hi> nor any more of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not being concerned in it. <hi>Shepard</hi> named young <hi>Hamden</hi> frequently as concerned in theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

The Deponent ſaw Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ramſay,</hi> lurking after the Plot broke out, before the Proclamation ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gone to <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> in the back of <hi>Biſhop-gate ſtreet,</hi> at ſome new Building, whether he was directed by <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſswood,</hi> who was deſirous to know how things went. <hi>Ramſay</hi> was not of the Deponent his acquaintance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but they knew as little of the matter as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent. This is what the Deponent remembers, and if any thing come to his Memory, he is to deliver it in betwixt and the firſt of <hi>October;</hi> And this is the Truth, as he ſhall Anſwer to God.</p>
